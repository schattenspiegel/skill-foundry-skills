# SymPy Python

Produce exact, assumption-aware symbolic code whose expression domain,
transformation goal, solution set, and numeric boundary are explicit.

## Core object model

| Object | Meaning | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| `Symbol` and assumptions | Atomic unknown with declared mathematical properties. | Variables whose domain affects simplification and solving. |
| `Expr` | Immutable symbolic expression tree. | Algebra, calculus, substitution, rewriting, and exact evaluation. |
| `Eq`/relations | Symbolic proposition, not assignment. | Equations and inequalities. |
| `Set` | Exact solution/domain representation. | `solveset`, intervals, unions, finite/conditional solutions. |
| `Poly` | Polynomial with explicit generators/domain. | Polynomial algorithms and coefficient domains. |
| `Matrix` / matrix expressions | Concrete symbolic entries or symbolic linear algebra. | Shape-aware linear algebra. |

SymPy expressions are immutable; operations return new objects. Python integers
and `sympy.Integer` can participate exactly, but a Python float introduces a
binary approximation before SymPy sees it. Assumptions are attached when a
Symbol is created; redefining the same printed name does not mutate the old
symbol. Read [expressions, domains, and assumptions](references/object-model.md).

## Ordered workflow

1. Define symbols, domains, assumptions, and whether the required result is an
   expression, identity, equation, set, proof condition, or approximation.
2. Construct exact inputs with SymPy numbers/rationals and explicit functions.
3. Choose a targeted transformation from the desired normal form; avoid
   undirected `simplify()` when a specific operation is known.
4. Solve in the declared domain and preserve conditions/unsolved cases.
5. Verify symbolically by substitution, residual simplification, equivalence
   under assumptions, or differentiation/integration as applicable.
6. Cross the numeric boundary deliberately with `evalf` for a few values or
   `lambdify` for repeated array evaluation; define backend and precision.
7. Test singularities, excluded domain points, branch cuts, multiple/no/infinite
   solutions, exact-versus-float input, and equivalent forms.

## Decision rules

- Use `subs` for structural substitution. It does not mutate. For simultaneous
  or order-sensitive replacement, inspect and specify the installed contract.
- Use `expand`, `factor`, `cancel`, `apart`, `collect`, `trigsimp`, or `powsimp`
  when that exact form is required. Use `simplify` only when “simpler” is an
  acceptable heuristic result and tests assert meaning rather than spelling.
- Prefer `solveset` when domain and complete set semantics matter. Use `solve`
  only with an explicit expected return contract; its output shape varies with
  equations, symbols, flags, and solution structure.
- Use `Eq(lhs, rhs)` for an equation. `=` is Python assignment and `==` is
  structural equality, not a general mathematical equivalence proof.
- Use `Poly(expr, generators, domain=...)` for polynomial-domain algorithms;
  do not assume every expression in powers is a polynomial over the intended
  coefficient domain.
- Use `lambdify` only for trusted expressions and an explicit numeric backend.
  It uses code-generation/evaluation mechanisms and must not consume untrusted
  input.

Read [operations and numeric boundaries](references/operations.md).

## Canonical anchor

```python
import sympy as sp

x = sp.Symbol("x", real=True)
rate = sp.Symbol("rate", positive=True)
expr = sp.exp(-rate * x)

integral = sp.integrate(expr, (x, 0, sp.oo))
assert sp.simplify(integral - 1 / rate) == 0

roots = sp.solveset(x**2 - 2, x, domain=sp.S.Reals)
assert roots == sp.FiniteSet(-sp.sqrt(2), sp.sqrt(2))
```

Positivity makes the improper integral convergent and permits the intended
result. The solution domain excludes complex roots by contract.

## High-risk rules

- Construct `sp.Rational(1, 3)` or `sp.S(1) / 3`, not `sp.Rational(1 / 3)`;
  the latter receives an already rounded Python float.
- Do not compare symbolic objects in Python `if` unless the relation is known
  boolean. An unresolved relation is not `False`; handle assumptions/conditions.
- Structural `==` can reject mathematically equal expressions. Verify a residual
  with a targeted transform under stated assumptions, while respecting domains
  and singularities.
- Transformations can change apparent domains or branch behavior. Test excluded
  points and complex branches before treating rewritten forms as equivalent.
- Before cancelling an additive rational expression, use `together` and record
  the denominator roots from that uncancelled combined form. `fraction(expr)`
  alone can report denominator `1` for a sum of fractions. If the incoming
  expression already auto-cancelled, its lost exclusions cannot be recovered;
  preserve the original domain contract separately.
- Solvers can return `ConditionSet`, parameterized families, dictionaries,
  tuples, or sets. Do not coerce these to a guessed list and lose conditions.
- Avoid wildcard imports in production; explicit `import sympy as sp` prevents
  collisions with Python/NumPy names.
- `lambdify` chooses numeric semantics from modules and can emit unsafe code for
  untrusted expressions. Keep parsing and evaluation behind a trust boundary.
- Exact symbolic computation can explode in time/memory. Use targeted
  transformations, assumptions, expression-size limits, and numeric fallbacks
  under an explicit accuracy contract.

## Version grounding and completion

The current stable documentation is SymPy 1.14.0; it is not installed in the
foundry environment. Check the installed version with `sp.__version__`, then inspect
function signatures and solver/printing behavior. Read [verification](references/verification.md).

Completion requires exact inputs, explicit assumptions/domain, the requested
normal form or solution contract, symbolic residual/equivalence checks,
singular/branch tests, safe numeric conversion, and no loss of conditions or
precision at the boundary.
